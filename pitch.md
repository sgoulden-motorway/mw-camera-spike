- We are Rage Against the Profiling
- Our mission for Hackday: Empower the chronically underserved with an innnovative profiling solution.

- Current landscape
- Reviews
- It is bleak.

- How do we help X?
- Picture of X's review.
- Let me show you... ðŸ‘€

- We have built a solution we're temporarily calling profiling-as-a-service (pending a more metal name).

- Here we see X who has been stuck on the first stage of profiling for some time now.
- And here you see the entry point into our product (imagine you are X)...

- X clicks the link which redirects them to this standalone application.

- At first they see an explainer step putting their mind at ease for the following steps.
- After they've read the explainer X continues to the next screen.

- On this screen X can see IN REALTIME all registered profilers in their vicinity.
- X selects a time that works well for them and clicks on the Request Button.
- This has a twofold effect...
- Firstly it confirms the card from which to take a small payment for the profiler's time.
- Secondly it broadcasts IN REALTIME a profiling request to all online profilers.

- Now imagine you are seasoned profiler Theo or any other online profiler.
- Theo receives a notification IN REALTIME requesting profiling for X at 5pm today.
- Theo realises he's free and fancies earning some small change for taking a few pictures.
- Theo accepts the request.

- X now receives a notification IN REALTIME, letting them know their request has been accepted.
- X also receives a QR code for the profiler to scan when they arrive.

- Cue 5pm.

- Theo arrives.
- Theo selects the job he is punctually attending and hits Begin.
- Theo scans the QR code on X's phone and...
- He's away!
- Theo is now able to complete the profiling journey on X's behalf.

- We estimate this will save -- hours based on the 10% of enquiries hitting QA failed and taking on average -- hours longer.
- It will also enable people like X to have an equal opportunity at selling their car.
- And most importantly, it will save X's back.

- Thank you all for listening and... Stay Metal ðŸ¤˜
